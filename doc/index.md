# CC: Tweaked

This is a small website to test documentation generation from Lua source code.

This is still very much in the proof-of-concept stage. We've rolled own own documentation
generation tool, and there's a couple of missing features. Furthermore, Java-based APIs
(such as Lua builtins, or @{os}) are not documented.

For more information, please check out [the GitHub issue][gh_issue] and [the
documented source][gh_branch].
